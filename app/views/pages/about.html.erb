          <p>
            In 1997, I came to the United States during the Yugoslavian War with my parents. This was our chance to

            fulfill our dreams. After completing high school in 2005 I went on to graduate at Bellevue University with

            a diploma in Business Management. After college I decided to put my degree to work. My dad helped

            me start my own small business. At first we acquired several rental properties and we specialized in

            property management. Eventually my Dad and I decided we wanted to expand our business and start

            building homes. Together we now have a combined total of over 30 years in the construction business.

          </p>
          <p>

            Customer, Cost, Communication, and Courtesy to every client is the mission of 4C. I believe that building

            a new home begins with dedication to customer service before, during, and after the completion of the

            construction. Exceeding customer expectations is something that I pride myself in. My hands-on

            experience building custom homes has developed into a thorough understanding and in-depth

            knowledge of the entire construction process.
