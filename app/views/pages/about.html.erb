          <p>
            In 1997, I came to the United States during the Yugoslavian War with my parents. This was our chance to

            fulfill our dreams. After completing high school in 2005 I went on to graduate at Bellevue University with

            a diploma in Business Management. After college I decided to put my degree to work. My dad helped

            me start my own small business. At first we acquired several rental properties and we specialized in

            property management. Eventually my Dad and I decided we wanted to expand our business and start

            building homes. Together we now have a combined total of over 30 years in the construction business.

          </p>
          <p>

            Customer, Cost, Communication, and Courtesy to every client is the mission of 4C. I believe that building

            a new home begins with dedication to customer service before, during, and after the completion of the

            construction. Exceeding customer expectations is something that I pride myself in. My hands-on

            experience building custom homes has developed into a thorough understanding and in-depth

            knowledge of the entire construction process.

          <p>
            Brad Bebermeyer is originally from Southern California and moved around the Western portion of the U.S. till
            he found his home in Nebraska. After playing baseball and earning a Bachelor’s Degree in Secondary Education
            at York College in York, Nebraska he went on to teach Social Studies for three years at the high school
            level. With two young children Brad made the choice to switch careers and support his wife’s decision to
            stay at home to raise them. Now with 7 years of sales experience in the professional world he thought it was
            a natural transition to follow his father’s footsteps who is a real estate broker in California.
            Brad’s faith, family, and friends are the top priorities in his life. His beautiful wife, Kristi, works
            locally in the pre-school Director at Stonebridge Christian Church. When his two children, Donovan and
            Peyton, are not in school the family always makes time to play baseball and video games, watch movies or
            play with Scout and Eleanor Rigby, their family dogs.
            Nebraska Realty is a perfect fit for the Bebermeyer family and Brad is excited to be employed by a brokerage
            that operates under the same value system that he does.

          <p>
            Born and raised in Indianola, Iowa my kids and I now love calling Omaha our home. It's been a journey to get
            here!

            I grew up loving animals, my grandparent's farms and showing cattle. I have a degree in Fashion
            Merchandising with a minor in Business from Iowa State University. After graduation I was an Assistant Buyer
            and Department Manager for Younkers before working in Human Resources in Minneapolis and Omaha. Later I
            spent time in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and also was blessed to travel in Europe and South America.

            As an adult I realized my childhood dream to take riding lessons, own racehorses and watch my daughter show
            Hunter/Jumpers.

            I love homes and am very excited to be a part of the Nebrask Realty family. I'd be honored to use my diverse
            background and knowledge to help you sell/buy your home.
